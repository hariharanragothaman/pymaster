"""
NOTE:
    The heapq library only provides min-heap functionality
    If you want max-heap - you need to write custom methods.

    Use a heap - when all you care about is the largest (or) smallest elements
               - and you do not need to support fast look-up, delete or search for arbitrary elements

    Compute the k-largest elements  - min-heap
    Compute the k-smallest elements - max-heap
        < Decide based on what you want to evict >
