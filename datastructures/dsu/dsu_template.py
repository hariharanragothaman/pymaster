This data-structure can help us group nodes into different sets.

Through this, we can eventually
1. Find number of connected components.
2. How many sets of connected components & find the connected components
3. Determine if there is a cycle in the graph

Future applications
1. Path-compression etc. - Makes sense. If we just know the representative, that's enough? Good point

### Lets take a look at an example problem
"""
Initially We have an undirected graph with N vertices and 0 edges. Process the following Q queries in order:



I/P - The first line is N, Q - number of vertices and Q queries.
Each query is of the format (t, u, v)
if t == 0, Connect u and v - create a vertex b/w them
if t == 1 , tell if u and v are connected?  
    - In general we would have done DFS - but since this is in the form of queries 
      we need to use DSU
