This is just an example for replacing only for a specific count
Reference Problem

You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. Polycarp wants to remove exactly k characters (k≤n) from the string s.
Polycarp uses the following algorithm k times:

Algorithm as follows:
a. if there is at least one letter 'a', remove the leftmost occurrence and stop the algorithm, otherwise go to next item;
b. if there is at least one letter 'b', remove the leftmost occurrence and stop the algorithm, otherwise go to next item;
...
z. remove the leftmost occurrence of the letter 'z' and stop the algorithm.
This algorithm removes a single letter from the string. Polycarp performs this algorithm exactly k times, thus removing exactly k characters.

Help Polycarp find the resulting string.

Input:
The first line of input contains two integers n and k (1≤k≤n≤4⋅105) — the length of the string and the number of letters Polycarp will remove.
The second line contains the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.

Output:
Print the string that will be obtained from s after Polycarp removes exactly k letters using the above algorithm k times.

If the resulting string is empty, print nothing. It is allowed to print nothing or an empty line (line break).
