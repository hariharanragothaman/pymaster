        1. Like how we do nested for loop - to generate all substrings, do the same thing
        2. But we need to do a few things smartly.
        3. Here we are updating a Counter as we are collecting substrings from a starting point.
        4. As we are collecting, let's count the max_cnt of each digit, 
            and we would know how many  distinct numbers we collected, as it's the length of the key of dict
        5. Now let's do max_cnt in dict * unique elemnts == right - left + 1
        6. To store the substrings, we use that math -hash to store them, instead of slicing and complicating
