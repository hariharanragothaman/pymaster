"""
Welcome to the concept of in-degree and out-degree
It's the longest path from in-degree (0) to out-degree (0)

Step1: Compute the in-degree for each vertex present in DAG
       Initialize count of visited nodes as zzero

Step2: Pick all vertexes with indegree of zero and add them to the Queue

Step3: Remove the vertex from the queue
       Increment visited count by 1
       decrease in-degree() by 1 for all it's neighbours(popped node reference)

Repeat Step3 until queue is empty.
