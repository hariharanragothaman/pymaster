# Check if graph is bi-partite -- Graph Theory

"""
Recall that a graph is bipartite
if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B
such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

It turns out the graph is bipartite, when it does not contain a cycle, with
an odd number of edges.
